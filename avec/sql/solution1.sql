submission each day (starting on the first day of the contest), 
and find the hacker_id and name of the hacker who made maximum number of submissions each day. 
If more than one such hacker has a maximum number of submissions, print the lowest hacker_id. 
The query should print this information for each day of the contest, sorted by the date.'
